"Femoral bone and marrow blood flow during reloading was significantly reduced in rats after 7 and 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU), with more widespread reductions observed at 14 days.",1
Vascular resistance in all femoral regions was elevated during reloading in 14-day HU rats compared to controls.,0
